# Challenge-5-

## Description
This application was created for the purpose to serve as a simple calendar that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am-5pm). This application demomstrates my knowledge of Javascript and 3rd party APIs to create a work day activity planner that saves user entries to localStorage. Highlighted proficiencis throughout working on this site:
* jQuery
* third party APIs; dayjs
* local storage 
* event listeners

## User Story
```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```


## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
